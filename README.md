## Why LLama_cpp?
Many average computer person do not have a strong nvidia graphics card. AI technology is hard to use

If someone has an interest to use AI tools like CHATGPT, you pay subscription and use it when server is not down.

A local LLM is hard without GPU support and thats why LLama_cpp comes in!

LLama_cpp speaks C++, easily fit in many devices. For python users, it allows us to port using library, **llama_cpp_python**.
